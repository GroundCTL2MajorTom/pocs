#### vulnerability 1    tracert

The vulnerability requires login credentials `stok`

vulnerability 1 appears in the sub_2D85A function of the dsd binary file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2650aacf-010d-499b-b082-a4c22e3ae6c6)


jso_obj_get_string_origin takes the addr from the tracert variable transferred by http service(httpd passes the request parameters to dsd ),concatenates it into the variable s with snprintf, and finally the system executes the s string.

##### **POC**

#### vulnerability 2    ping

The vulnerability requires login credentials `stok`

Vulnerability 2 appears in the sub_2D85A function of the dsd binary file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16378359-1965-4d06-b4c5-6abe23148969)


jso_obj_get_string_origin takes the addr from the ping variable transferred by http service(httpd passes the request parameters to dsd)ï¼Œv26 received the value of addr

taint propagation process: v26-- >v27---->s1---->s-- >sytstem

snprintf concatenates the variable s1 containing the malicious code into s, and the system executes the s string.
